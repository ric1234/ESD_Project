# ESD_Project
#In this project two games, SNAKE and RACING were designed and tested on an 8051 board.
#It consists primarily of 8051 board as the CPU and Graphic LCD as a display. The 8051 loads the game and runs it by utilizing internal and external memory space to display on Graphic LCD.
#Graphic LCD helps in improving the user interface. A gaming controller is used to control the game.
#An NVSRAM was interfaced for memory of the game.
